Hi, I'm Rory.

I am a software engineer at [Candela Technologies](www.candelatech.com).
My little slice of the development pie there focuses on core LANforge technologies, and these days I tend to be very wireless-driver focused.
You can find some of my work for this among the open source [CT kernels](https://github.com/greearb?tab=repositories&q=linux-ct-).

I have previously studied computer vision as a graduate student.
The main focus of my graduate research was the development of an autoencoder with a latent structured for "timescale disentanglement".
This meant that the latent space was organized by a clear separation of temporal frequencies.
You can read the paper that I submitted to Western Washington University's graduate committee on the project [here](about/Video_Generation_Paper.pdf).
