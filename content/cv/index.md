## Western Washington University
### Graduate Researcher
*09/2021 -- 06/2023*
- Developed both an autoencoder network to encode frames from long term capture video sources into a latent space organized by timescales, as well as a novel video generation network with similar properties.
- Experimented with and developed new techniques for loading video frames as training data in such a way that the data has both stochastic and well organized properties.
- Experimented with possible ways of using the above mentioned model to smoothly interpolate temporally through a scene at various timescales.
- Designed and implemented key tools and data infrastructure for this and future projects using a similar model.

### Research Assistant
*04/2019 -- 03/2020*
- Developed the Muze programming language, a research language with runtime typed pointers, Algol-like syntax, and a type system hierarchy based on definable implicit type coercion.
- Contributed to the design of the language, including the syntax, type system, semantics, and memory model.
- Developed the compiler, including work on the parser/AST, type checker, and testing framework.

### Teaching Assistant
*09/2019 -- 03/2020, 09/2021 -- 06/2023*
- Assisted in a multitude of classes, including Intro to Computer Programming, Formal Languages and Functional Programming, Computer Systems, Operating Systems, and Intro to Data Science.
- Involved in preparing and grading coursework.
- Led lab sections and provided guidance for students through office hours.
